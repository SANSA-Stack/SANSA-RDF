     * parse errors in the assembled head/body/tail buffers. So the reason is, that RDFDataMgrRx tries
     * to interrupt the producer thread of the RDF parser (if there is one). However, FileChannel
     * extends AbstractInterruptibleChannel which in turn closes itself if during read the thread is interrupted.
